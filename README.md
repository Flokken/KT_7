# KT_7
A PC game based on Python (Pygame).

Resources (three folder: "image", "audio", and "font") could be found from game zip files. 
Download game zip of correct version and place these three folders with codes (12 altogether).

Then run main.py and the program will start.

# Important update on codes for game version 7.4.3
1. We split "mapManager" module into three smaller modules: "mapTowers", "mapElems", and "canvas".
2. We make "props" an independent module (from "myHero").
3. We make "specifier" and independent module (from "model").

You can find notes about each module's duty at the beginning of each file.
