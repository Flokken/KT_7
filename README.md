# Project Introduction
Knight Throde is a PC game based on Python (Pygame). More details can be found in the instruction pdf file.

# Missing Resources
Resources (three folders-"image", "audio", and "font") could be found from game zip files. 
Download game zip of correct version and place these three folders with codes (12 altogether), then run main.py.

Game v7.4.3 has been released on Steam. You can access all the resources after downloading the game there.

# Updates on Codes for Game Version 7.4.3
You may find the architecture different from the instruction pdf, big changes include:
1. We split "mapManager" module into three smaller modules: "mapTowers", "mapElems", and "canvas".
2. We make "props" an independent module (from "myHero").
3. We make "specifier" and independent module (from "model").

You can find notes about each module's duty at the beginning of each file.
